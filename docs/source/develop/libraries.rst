Client Libraries
================

Currently there are client libraries for four platforms/languages:

- **Java / Kotlin** for backend and Android
- **JavaScript** for backend and web applications
- **Python** for backend applications and miscellaneous scripts
- **Swift** for iOS 

In the current section you can find brief descriptions for how to use all 
of these libraries and where to get their source code in case you want to make contribution.
